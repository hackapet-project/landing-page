* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed (which includes npm). We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **Yarn (Optional):** If the project uses Yarn as a package manager, install it globally:
    ```sh
    npm install --global yarn
    ```

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/hackapet-project/landing-page.git](https://github.com/hackapet-project/landing-page.git)
    cd hackapet-website
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    Or, if the project uses Yarn:
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    Using npm:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Or, if using Yarn:
    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified in your console) with your browser to see the result.

4.  **Build for production:**
    To create an optimized production build:
    Using npm:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    Or, if using Yarn:
    ```sh
    yarn build
    ```
    This will typically generate the build in a `.next` folder.
