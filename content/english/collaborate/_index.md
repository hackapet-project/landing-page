# How to Collaborate with Hackapet?

Hackapet is an open and collaborative project that depends on the participation of people passionate about animal welfare and technology. There are several ways you can contribute and become part of our mission:

## 1. Contribute Your Skills

If you have skills in software development, design, project management, or any other related area, your experience can be invaluable to Hackapet. Here’s how you can contribute:

- **Developer:** Help improve our open-source platform by creating new features, fixing bugs, or enhancing the user experience.
- **Designer:** Contribute with graphic designs, UX/UI, or promotional materials to help communicate our mission more effectively.
- **Project Manager:** Coordinate efforts, organize tasks, and ensure the team is aligned with our objectives.
- **Communicator:** Help spread the word about Hackapet through social media, blogs, or direct contact with shelters and rescues.

## 2. Spread Our Mission

Another important way to collaborate is by helping to spread our mission. The more people know about Hackapet, the more we can grow and help more shelters. Here are some ideas:

- **Social Media:** Share our posts, invite your friends to follow us, and talk about us on your networks.
- **Events:** Organize or participate in local events to talk about Hackapet and our initiatives.
