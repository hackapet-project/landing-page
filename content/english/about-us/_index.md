# The Team

We are a diverse team of developers, managers, designers, and passionate volunteers, united by the goal of improving the lives of animals in shelters and facilitating their adoption. Our mission is to help animal shelters optimize their processes, making adoption easier and enhancing the well-being of pets. Through Hackapet, we aim not only to contribute to a noble cause but also to learn and grow together as a community.
